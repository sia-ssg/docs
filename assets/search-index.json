Step 4: Start the Development Server npm run dev Or use the Sia command directly: sia dev You should see output like: 🚀 Starting development server... 📝 Server running at http: //localhost:3000 Step 5: View Your Site Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 . You should see your new Sia site! Step 6: Create Your First Post In a new terminal, create a blog post: npm run new post &quot;My First Post&quot; Or: sia new post &quot;My First Post&quot; This creates a new post in src/posts/ with today&#8217;s date. Step 7: Edit Your Post Open the newly created post file (e.g., src/posts/2024-12-17-my-first-post/index.md ) and add some content: --- title: &quot;My First Post&quot; date: 2024-12-17 tags: [welcome, first-post] --- ## Welcome!

    "content": "Plugin API The api object passed to hooks provides utilities for plugins to interact with the build system. API Methods api.config Full site configuration object (read-only recommended). Type: Object Example: hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { const siteUrl = api. config . site . url ; api. log ( `Site URL: ${siteUrl} ` , &#x27;info&#x27; ); } } Note: While you can modify api.config , it&#8217;s recommended to treat it as read-only to avoid unexpected behavior. api.writeFile(path, content) Write a file to the output directory. Parameters: path (string): File path relative to output directory content (string): File content Example: hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { const output = JSON . stringify (siteData, null , 2 ); api. writeFile ( &#x27;site-data.json&#x27; , output); } } Note: The path is relative to the output directory. Use api.joinPath() to construct paths safely. api.readFile(path) Read a file from the filesystem. Parameters: path (string): Absolute file path Returns: File content (string) Example: hooks : { beforeBuild : ( config, api ) =&gt; { const content = api. readFile ( &#x27;/absolute/path/to/file.txt&#x27; ); // Process content } } api.joinPath(...paths) Join path segments (wrapper around Node.js path.join ). Parameters: ...paths (string): Path segments Returns: Joined path (string) Example: hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { const outputPath = api. joinPath (config. outputDir , &#x27;data&#x27; , &#x27;index.json&#x27; ); api. writeFile (outputPath, JSON . stringify (siteData)); } } Note: This ensures cross-platform path compatibility (handles Windows vs Unix paths). api.log(message, level) Log a message during the build process. Parameters: message (string): Log message level (string): Log level - &#39;info&#39; , &#39;warn&#39; , or &#39;error&#39; (default: &#39;info&#39; ) Example: hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { api. log ( &#x27;Processing complete&#x27; , &#x27;info&#x27; ); api. log ( &#x27;Warning: something unusual&#x27; , &#x27;warn&#x27; ); api. log ( &#x27;Error occurred&#x27; , &#x27;error&#x27; ); } } Log Levels: &#39;info&#39; : Informational messages (default) &#39;warn&#39; : Warning messages &#39;error&#39; : Error messages Usage Examples Writing Multiple Files hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { // Write search index const searchData = { pages : siteData. collections . pages . map ( p =&gt; ({ title : p. title , url : p. url })) }; api. writeFile ( &#x27;search-index.json&#x27; , JSON . stringify (searchData, null , 2 )); // Write sitemap const sitemap = generateSitemap (siteData); api. writeFile ( &#x27;sitemap.xml&#x27; , sitemap); api. log ( &#x27;Generated search index and sitemap&#x27; , &#x27;info&#x27; ); } } Reading Configuration Files hooks : { beforeBuild : ( config, api ) =&gt; { try { const customConfig = api. readFile (api. joinPath (process. cwd (), &#x27;custom-config.json&#x27; )); const parsed = JSON . parse (customConfig); // Use parsed configuration } catch (err) { api. log ( &#x27;Could not read custom config&#x27; , &#x27;warn&#x27; ); } } } Error Handling with Logging hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { try { // Plugin logic api. log ( &#x27;Plugin executed successfully&#x27; , &#x27;info&#x27; ); } catch (err) { api. log ( `Plugin error: ${err.message} ` , &#x27;error&#x27; ); // Don&#x27;t throw - let the build continue } } } Path Construction hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { // Safe path construction const dataDir = api. joinPath (config. outputDir , &#x27;data&#x27; ); const indexPath = api. joinPath (dataDir, &#x27;index.json&#x27; ); api. writeFile (indexPath, JSON . stringify (siteData)); } } Best Practices Use api.joinPath() for paths - Ensures cross-platform compatibility Log appropriately - Use appropriate log levels ( info , warn , error ) Handle errors gracefully - Don&#8217;t throw errors unless necessary; log them instead Read-only config - Treat api.config as read-only to avoid side effects Async operations - Use async/await for file operations and external calls Related Plugin Hooks - Learn about hooks that receive the API object Creating Plugins - See API usage in examples",

Creating a Local Plugin Create a _plugins/ directory in your project root (if it doesn&#8217;t exist) Create a JavaScript file ( .js or .mjs ) in that directory Export a plugin object Example: _plugins/search-index.js export default { name : &#x27;search-index&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { // Generate search index const searchData = { pages : siteData. collections . pages . map ( item =&gt; ({ title : item. title , url : item. url , excerpt : item. excerpt , tags : item. tags })), posts : siteData. collections . posts . map ( item =&gt; ({ title : item. title , url : item. url , date : item. date . toISOString (), excerpt : item. excerpt , tags : item. tags })), notes : siteData. collections . notes . map ( item =&gt; ({ title : item. title , url : item. url , date : item. date . toISOString (), excerpt : item. excerpt })) }; // Write search index file const outputPath = api. joinPath (config. outputDir , &#x27;search-index.json&#x27; ); api. writeFile (outputPath, JSON . stringify (searchData, null , 2 )); api. log ( &#x27;Generated search index&#x27; , &#x27;info&#x27; ); } } }; Local Plugin with Configuration You can access plugin-specific configuration from config.plugins.config : export default { name : &#x27;search-index&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , configSchema : { outputPath : { type : &#x27;string&#x27; , default : &#x27;search-index.json&#x27; }, includeContent : { type : &#x27;boolean&#x27; , default : false } }, hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { const pluginConfig = config. plugins ?. config ?.[ &#x27;search-index&#x27; ] || {}; const outputPath = pluginConfig. outputPath || &#x27;search-index.json&#x27; ; const includeContent = pluginConfig. includeContent || false ; const searchData = { pages : siteData. collections . pages . map ( item =&gt; ({ title : item. title , url : item. url , excerpt : item. excerpt , ...(includeContent &amp;&amp; { content : item. content }) })), // ... posts, notes }; api. writeFile ( api. joinPath (config. outputDir , outputPath), JSON . stringify (searchData, null , 2 ) ); } } }; Configure in _config.yml : plugins: config: search-index: outputPath: search-index.json includeContent: false NPM Package Plugins NPM package plugins can be shared with the community and installed via npm. Creating an NPM Package Plugin Create a new npm package with name starting with sia-plugin- Set up the package structure Export the plugin object Package Structure sia-plugin-example/ ├── package .json ├── index .js ├── README .md └── LICENSE package.json { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;sia-plugin-example&quot; , &quot;version&quot; : &quot;1.0.0&quot; , &quot;description&quot; : &quot;Example Sia plugin&quot; , &quot;main&quot; : &quot;index.js&quot; , &quot;type&quot; : &quot;module&quot; , &quot;keywords&quot; : [ &quot;sia&quot; , &quot;sia-plugin&quot; , &quot;static-site-generator&quot; ] , &quot;author&quot; : &quot;Your Name&quot; , &quot;license&quot; : &quot;MIT&quot; , &quot;engines&quot; : { &quot;node&quot; : &quot;&gt;=18.0.0&quot; } , &quot;peerDependencies&quot; : { &quot;@terrymooreii/sia&quot; : &quot;^2.0.0&quot; } } index.js export default { name : &#x27;sia-plugin-example&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , configSchema : { enabled : { type : &#x27;boolean&#x27; , default : true }, outputFile : { type : &#x27;string&#x27; , default : &#x27;example-output.json&#x27; } }, hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { const pluginConfig = config. plugins ?. config ?.[ &#x27;sia-plugin-example&#x27; ] || {}; if (pluginConfig. enabled === false ) { return ; } const output = { buildDate : new Date (). toISOString (), totalPages : siteData. collections . pages . length , totalPosts : siteData. collections . posts . length , totalNotes : siteData. collections . notes . length , totalTags : siteData. allTags . length }; api. writeFile ( api. joinPath (config. outputDir , pluginConfig. outputFile || &#x27;example-output.json&#x27; ), JSON . stringify (output, null , 2 ) ); api. log ( `Generated ${pluginConfig.outputFile} ` , &#x27;info&#x27; ); } } }; Installing and Using Users install your plugin: npm install sia-plugin-example Then configure it in _config.yml : plugins: config: sia-plugin-example: enabled: true outputFile: stats.json Advanced Examples Content Transformation Plugin Transform content during parsing: export default { name : &#x27;content-transformer&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , hooks : { beforeMarkdown : ( markdown, context ) =&gt; { // Replace custom syntax return markdown. replace ( /\\[TOC\\]/g , &#x27;&lt;!-- Table of Contents --&gt;&#x27; ); }, afterMarkdown : ( html, context ) =&gt; { // Inject custom HTML return html. replace ( &#x27;&lt;!-- Table of Contents --&gt;&#x27; , &#x27;&lt;nav class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;...&lt;/nav&gt;&#x27; ); } } }; Custom Template Filter Plugin Add custom Nunjucks filters: export default { name : &#x27;custom-filters&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , hooks : { addTemplateFilter : ( env, config ) =&gt; { // Add a filter to format numbers env. addFilter ( &#x27;formatNumber&#x27; , ( num ) =&gt; { return new Intl . NumberFormat (). format (num); }); // Add a filter to truncate text env. addFilter ( &#x27;truncate&#x27; , ( str, length = 50 ) =&gt; { if (str. length &lt;= length) return str; return str. substring ( 0 , length) + &#x27;...&#x27; ; }); } } }; Use in templates: {{ post.wordCount | formatNumber }} {{ post.excerpt | truncate( 100 ) }} Custom Marked Extension Plugin Add custom markdown syntax: import { addMarkedExtension } from &#x27;@terrymooreii/sia&#x27; ; export default { name : &#x27;custom-markdown&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , hooks : { beforeBuild : ( config, api ) =&gt; { addMarkedExtension ({ renderer : { // Custom blockquote renderer blockquote ( quote ) { return `&lt;blockquote class=&quot;custom-quote&quot;&gt; ${quote} &lt;/blockquote&gt;` ; } } }); } } }; Sitemap Generator Plugin Generate a sitemap.xml: export default { name : &#x27;sitemap-generator&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { const siteUrl = config. site . url . replace ( /\\/$/ , &#x27;&#x27; ); const basePath = config. site . basePath || &#x27;&#x27; ; const urls = []; // Add homepage urls. push ({ loc : ` ${siteUrl} ${basePath} /` , lastmod : new Date (). toISOString (). split ( &#x27;T&#x27; )[ 0 ], changefreq : &#x27;daily&#x27; , priority : &#x27;1.0&#x27; }); // Add all content items for ( const [collectionName, items] of Object . entries (siteData. collections )) { for ( const item of items) { urls. push ({ loc : ` ${siteUrl} ${item.url} ` , lastmod : item. date . toISOString (). split ( &#x27;T&#x27; )[ 0 ], changefreq : &#x27;monthly&#x27; , priority : collectionName === &#x27;pages&#x27; ? &#x27;0.8&#x27; : &#x27;0.6&#x27; }); } } // Generate XML const sitemap = `&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt; &lt;urlset xmlns=&quot;http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9&quot;&gt; ${urls.map(url =&gt; ` &lt;url&gt; &lt;loc&gt; ${url.loc} &lt;/loc&gt; &lt;lastmod&gt; ${url.lastmod} &lt;/lastmod&gt; &lt;changefreq&gt; ${url.changefreq} &lt;/changefreq&gt; &lt;priority&gt; ${url.priority} &lt;/priority&gt; &lt;/url&gt;` ).join( &#x27;\\n&#x27; )} &lt;/urlset&gt;` ; api. writeFile ( api. joinPath (config. outputDir , &#x27;sitemap.xml&#x27; ), sitemap ); api. log ( &#x27;Generated sitemap.xml&#x27; , &#x27;info&#x27; ); } } }; Plugin with Dependencies Plugins can depend on other plugins: export default { name : &#x27;enhanced-search&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , dependencies : [ &#x27;search-index&#x27; ], // Requires search-index plugin hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { // This plugin enhances the search index created by search-index plugin // It runs after search-index because of the dependency } } }; Best Practices 1. Error Handling Always handle errors gracefully: hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { try { // Plugin logic } catch (err) { api. log ( `Plugin error: ${err.message} ` , &#x27;error&#x27; ); // Don&#x27;t throw - let the build continue } } } 2. Configuration Validation Validate plugin configuration: hooks : { beforeBuild : ( config, api ) =&gt; { const pluginConfig = config. plugins ?. config ?.[ &#x27;my-plugin&#x27; ] || {}; if (pluginConfig. requiredOption === undefined ) { throw new Error ( &#x27;my-plugin: requiredOption is required&#x27; ); } } } 3. Async Operations Use async/await for asynchronous operations: hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { const data = await fetchExternalData (); // Process data } } 4. Logging Use the API&#8217;s logging function: api. log ( &#x27;Processing complete&#x27; , &#x27;info&#x27; ); api. log ( &#x27;Warning: something unusual&#x27; , &#x27;warn&#x27; ); api. log ( &#x27;Error occurred&#x27; , &#x27;error&#x27; ); 5. Documentation Document your plugin: Explain what it does List configuration options Provide usage examples Include version compatibility 6. Testing Test your plugin: Create a test Sia site Add your plugin Run sia build Verify the output 7. Version Compatibility Specify Sia version requirements in your plugin&#8217;s README: ## Requirements - Sia &gt;= 2.0.0 - Node.js &gt;= 18.0.0 Publishing NPM Plugins Prepare your package: Write a clear README Add a LICENSE file Test thoroughly Publish to npm: npm login npm publish Tag your releases: git tag v1.0.0 git push --tags Update documentation: Add to Sia&#8217;s plugin list (if applicable) Share on social media/forums Troubleshooting Plugin Not Loading Check that the plugin file is in _plugins/ or installed via npm Verify the plugin exports a default object with name and version Check console output for error messages Hook Not Executing Verify the hook name is correct Check that the hook function is properly defined Ensure the plugin is enabled ( plugins.enabled: true ) Configuration Not Working Verify configuration is in config.plugins.config[pluginName] Check that plugin name matches exactly (case-sensitive) Validate configuration structure matches configSchema Build Failing Set plugins.strictMode: false to see detailed error messages Check plugin dependencies are installed Verify Node.js version compatibility Resources Plugin Hooks - Complete hook reference Plugin API - API utilities available to plugins Plugin Configuration - Configuration options Plugin Structure - Plugin structure and discovery Sia GitHub Repository - Source code and issues Marked Documentation - For custom markdown extensions Nunjucks Documentation - For custom template filters/functions",

    "content": "Plugins Sia includes a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend functionality at key points in the build lifecycle. Plugins can be created locally in your project or published as npm packages. What Are Plugins? Plugins are JavaScript modules that export a plugin object with hooks that execute at specific points during the build process. They can: Transform content before or after parsing Generate additional files (search indexes, sitemaps, etc.) Add custom Marked extensions for markdown processing Register custom Nunjucks template filters and functions Modify site data before rendering Perform post-build tasks Quick Start Using a Plugin Install a plugin (if it&#8217;s an npm package): npm install sia-plugin-example Configure it in _config.yml : plugins: config: sia-plugin-example: enabled: true That&#8217;s it! The plugin will run automatically during builds.

    "title": "Plugin Structure",
    "url": "/plugins/structure/",
    "content": "Plugin Structure This guide covers the structure of plugins, how they&#8217;re discovered, and how errors are handled. Plugin Structure A plugin must export an object with the following structure: export default { name : &#x27;plugin-name&#x27; , // Required: Unique plugin identifier version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , // Required: Plugin version dependencies : [], // Optional: Array of plugin names this depends on configSchema : {}, // Optional: Configuration schema hooks : { // Optional: Hook functions afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { // Plugin logic } } }; Required Fields name Unique identifier for the plugin (string). This should match the plugin&#8217;s npm package name (if published) or be a descriptive name for local plugins. Example: export default { name : &#x27;sia-plugin-search&#x27; , // ... }; Note: For npm packages, the name should start with sia-plugin- . For local plugins, any name is acceptable. version Plugin version (string). Follows semantic versioning (e.g., &#39;1.0.0&#39; ). Example: export default { name : &#x27;my-plugin&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , // ... }; Optional Fields dependencies Array of plugin names that must load before this plugin. Plugins listed here will be loaded and executed before this plugin. Example: export default { name : &#x27;enhanced-search&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , dependencies : [ &#x27;search-index&#x27; ], // Requires search-index plugin hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { // This plugin enhances the search index created by search-index plugin // It runs after search-index because of the dependency } } }; Note: Circular dependencies are not supported and will cause an error. configSchema Object describing plugin configuration options (for documentation purposes). This doesn&#8217;t enforce validation automatically, but helps document what configuration options are available. Example: export default { name : &#x27;my-plugin&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , configSchema : { outputPath : { type : &#x27;string&#x27; , default : &#x27;output.json&#x27; }, enabled : { type : &#x27;boolean&#x27; , default : true }, maxItems : { type : &#x27;number&#x27; , default : 100 } }, hooks : { // ... } }; hooks Object mapping hook names to hook functions. See Plugin Hooks for a complete reference. Example: export default { name : &#x27;my-plugin&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , hooks : { beforeBuild : ( config, api ) =&gt; { // Initialize }, afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { // Process } } }; Plugin Discovery Sia discovers plugins from two sources: 1. Local Plugins Files in the _plugins/ directory ( .js or .mjs files). Structure: project-root / ├── _plugins / │ ├── search-index.js │ └── sitemap-generator.js └── _config.yml Example: // _plugins/search-index.js export default { name : &#x27;search-index&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { // Plugin logic } } }; 2. NPM Package Plugins Packins in node_modules matching the pattern sia-plugin-* . Installation: npm install sia-plugin-search Discovery: Sia automatically discovers packages in node_modules that start with sia-plugin- . Plugin Loading Order Plugins are loaded in the following order: Dependency order - Plugins with dependencies load after their dependencies Explicit order - If plugins.order is specified in config, those plugins load first Discovery order - Remaining plugins load in discovery order Example: plugins: order: - sia-plugin-search - sia-plugin-sitemap In this case: sia-plugin-search loads first sia-plugin-sitemap loads second Other discovered plugins load after, in dependency order Error Handling By default, plugin errors are logged but don&#8217;t stop the build. Set plugins.strictMode: true in your config to fail the build on plugin errors. Error Types Errors include: Plugin loading failures - Plugin file can&#8217;t be loaded or doesn&#8217;t export correctly Hook execution errors - Errors thrown during hook execution Validation errors - Configuration or structure validation failures Error Messages Error messages include: Plugin name Detailed error information Stack trace (in development mode) Strict Mode With strictMode: true , any plugin error will cause the build to fail: plugins: strictMode: true With strictMode: false (default), errors are logged but the build continues: plugins: strictMode: false # Default Error Handling in Plugins Plugins should handle errors gracefully: hooks : { afterBuild : async (siteData, config, api) =&gt; { try { // Plugin logic that might fail await riskyOperation (); api. log ( &#x27;Operation successful&#x27; , &#x27;info&#x27; ); } catch (err) { api. log ( `Plugin error: ${err.message} ` , &#x27;error&#x27; ); // Don&#x27;t throw - let the build continue // Only throw if the error is critical } } } Module Systems Plugins can use either CommonJS or ES modules: ES Modules (Recommended) // _plugins/my-plugin.mjs export default { name : &#x27;my-plugin&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , hooks : { // ... } }; CommonJS // _plugins/my-plugin.js module . exports = { name : &#x27;my-plugin&#x27; , version : &#x27;1.0.0&#x27; , hooks : { // ... } }; Note: For npm packages, use ES modules ( &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot; in package.json ). Best Practices Unique names - Ensure plugin names are unique to avoid conflicts Version properly - Use semantic versioning for plugin versions Handle errors - Always wrap risky operations in try-catch Document dependencies - List all plugin dependencies in the dependencies array Use configSchema - Document configuration options even if not validated Related Plugin Configuration - Learn about configuring plugins Creating Plugins - See examples of plugin structure Plugin Hooks - Learn about available hooks",

Your custom CSS will completely replace the theme&#8217;s default styles. Theme Resolution Order Sia resolves themes in this order: Custom layouts/includes in your project Built-in themes External npm packages ( sia-theme-* ) This means your custom files take precedence over theme defaults. Example: Customizing the Header Copy the theme&#8217;s header include (if needed for reference) Create _includes/header.njk with your customizations Your custom header will be used instead of the theme&#8217;s default Best Practices Start with a built-in theme that&#8217;s close to what you want Override only what you need to change Keep customizations minimal for easier maintenance Document your customizations",
